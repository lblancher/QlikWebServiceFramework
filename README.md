QlikWebServiceFramework
=======================

A Java framework for Proxy'ing requests between Qlikview and a Web Service

This maven project creates a simple framework that can be added to allow Qlikview to connect to many different Web Services. 

There are currently a couple connectors embeded. I have create a proxy connector for Infusionsoft with DataCount and DataQuery URLS.

Also, the Politic web service from the Data Scientist Tool kit can be used from the Get2Get_JSON2XML proxy code.

Additional proxy's can be added in using the RESTEASY framework from Jboss.
